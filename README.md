# MythicKeystoneTracker
Mythic Keystone Tracker Addon for WoW

Mythic Keystone Tracker is a lightweight add-on that helps you track all your keystones on all your characters.



Features include:

* Listing keystones for all characters, regardless of faction or server
* Sorting by name, realm, item level, weekly best, or keystone level
* Displaying Mythic+ affixes for the week
* Reporting keystone info to various channels, including Communities
* Indicating whether a weekly chest was collected or not on a character
* Auto-inserting keystones into the pedestal and showing a player where the keystone is in their bag



Basic commands are:

* /mkt - this brings up the UI
* /mkt_iconshow - toggles the mini-map icon (default is enabled)
* /mkt_clear - clears the database, useful if something goes wrong if you want to clear your data
