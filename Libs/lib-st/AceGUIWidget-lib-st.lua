lib-st Beta Wrapper Widget

lib-st does not recycle the objects (called "ST" here) that it creates and
returns.  We therefore do not try to hold onto an ST when the widget is
being recycled.  This means that Constructor() does very little work, and
does not actually construct an ST.

OnAcquire cannot construct an ST either, because we don't yet have any
creation parameters from the user to feed to CreateST.  (Allowing such to
be passed along from AceGUI:Create() would require changes to core AceGUI
code, and I don't feel like trying to overcome that inertia.)

The upshot is that the widget returned from Create is broken and useless
until its CreateST member has been called.  This means that correct behavior
depends entirely on the user remembering to do so.

Version 1 initial functioning implementation
Version 2 reshuffle to follow new AceGUI widget coding style
Version 3 add .tail_offset, defaulting to same absolute value as .head_offset
Version 4 restore original frame methods, as fortold by ancient prophecy
Version 5 don't bogart the widget object

	Users with an ST already constructed can drop it into a widget directly
	using this routine.  It must be safe to call this more than once with
	new widgets on the same ST.

	This is where most of the intelligence of the wrapper is located.  That
	is, if you can call my code "intelligent" with a straight face.  Lemme
	try again.

	Think of the widget wrapper as a brain.  When ALL THREE neurons manage
	to fire at the same time and produce a thought, this function represents
	the thought.  Sigh.

	All of an ST's subframes are attached to its main frame, which we have in
	the st.frame link, and that's what AceGUI uses for all positioning.  Except
	that ST:SetDisplayCols creates its "head" row /above/ the main frame, and
	so the row of labels eats into whatever upper border space AceGUI calculates,
	often overlapping other elements.

	We get around this by replacing ST's main frame's SetPoint with a custom
	version that just moves everything down a few pixels to allow room for the
	head row.

	FIXME this may need to be a secure hook (ugh, would end up calling the real
	setpoint twice) rather than a replacement.
